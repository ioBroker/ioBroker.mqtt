# MQ Telemetry Transport for ioBroker (MQTT).

MQTT (formerly Message Queue Telemetry Transport) is a publish-subscribe based "light weight" messaging protocol for use on top of the TCP/IP protocol.
It is designed for connections with remote locations where a "small code footprint" is required and/or network bandwidth is limited.
The Publish-Subscribe messaging pattern requires a message broker. The broker is responsible for distributing messages to interested clients based on the topic of a message.
Historically, the 'MQ' in 'MQTT' came from IBM's MQ message queuing product line.

This adapter uses the MQTT.js library from https://github.com/adamvr/MQTT.js/

## Configuration
- **Type** - Select "Client" (If you want to receive and send messages to other broker) or "Server" if you want create own MQTT broker.

### Server settings
- **WebSockets** - if parallel to TCP Server, the WebSocket MQTT Server should run.
- **Port** - Port where the server will run (Default 1883). **WebSockets** will always run on port+1 (Default 1884)
- **SSL** - If TCP and WebSockets should run as secure server.
- **Authentication/User name** - If authentication required, you can specify username. It is suggested to always use SSL with authentication to not send passwords over unsequre connection.  
- **Authentication/Password** - Password for user.
- **Mask to publish own states** - Pattern to filter ioBroker states, which will be sent to clients. You can use wildcards to specify group of messages, e.g "*.memRss, mqtt.0.*" to get all memory states of all adapters and all states of adapter mqtt.0
- **Publish only on change** - New messages will be sent to client only if the state value changes. Every message sent by client will be accepted, even if the value does not changed.
- **Publish own states on connect** - by every client connection the all known states will be sent to client (defined by state mask), to say him which states has the ioBroker.
- **Prefix for all topics** - if set, every sent topic will be prepended with this prefix, e.g if prefix "iobroker/" all states will have names like "**iobroker**/mqtt/0/connected"
- **Trace output for every message** - Debug outputs.
- **Send states (ack=true) too** - Normally only the states/commands with ack=false will be sent to partner. If this flag is set every state independent from ack will be sent to partner. 
- **Use different topic names for set and get** - if active, so every state will have two topics: ```adapter/instance/stateName``` and ```adapter/instance/stateName/set```. In this case topic with "/set" will be used to send non acknowledged commands (ack: false) and topic without "/set" to receive state updates (with ack: true). The client will receive sent messages back in this mode.
- **Interval before send topics by connection** - Pause between connection and when all topics will be sent to client (if activated).
- **Send interval** - Interval between packets by sending all topics (if activated). Used only by once after the connection establishment.
- **Use chunk patch** - There is a problem with last update of mqtt-packet, that frames will be sent directly to client and not first completely built and then sent to client. Some old clients do not like such a packets and do not work with new library. To fix it you can activate this flag.

### Client settings
- **URL** - name or ip address of the broker/server. Like "localhost".
- **Port** - Port of the MQTT broker. By default 1883
- **Secure** - If secure (SSL) connection must be used.
- **User** - if broker required authentication, define here the user name.
- **Password** - if user name is not empty the password must be set. It can be empty.
- **Password confirmation** - repeat here the password.
- **Subscribe Patterns** - Subscribe pattern. See chapter "Examples of using wildcards" to define the pattern. '#' to subscribe for all topics. 'mqtt/0/#,javascript/#' to subscribe for states of mqtt.0 and javascript
- **Publish only on change** - Store incoming messages only if payload is differ from actual stored.
- **Mask to publish own states** - Mask for states, that must be published to broker. '*' - to publish all states. 'io.yr.*,io.hm-rpc.0.*' to publish states of "yr" and "hm-rpc" adapter.  
- **Publish all states at start** - Publish all states (defined by state mask) every time by connection establishment to announce own available states and their values.
- **Prefix for topics** - The prefix can be defined for own states. Like "/var/ioBroker/". Name of topics will be for example published with the name "/var/ioBroker/ping/192-168-1-5".
- **Test connection** - Press the button to check the connection to broker. Adapter must be enabled before.
- **Send states (ack=true) too** - Normally only the states/commands with ack=false will be sent to partner. If this flag is set every state independent from ack will be sent to partner. 
- **Use different topic names for set and get** - if active, so every state will have two topics: ```adapter/instance/stateName``` and ```adapter/instance/stateName/set```. In this case topic with "/set" will be used to send non acknowledged commands (ack: false) and topic without "/set" to receive state updates (with ack: true).
- **Persistent Session** - When checked the broker saves the session information of the adapter. This means it tracks which messages have been send / received by the adapter (only QoS Level 1 and 2) and to which topics the adapter has subscribed. This information survives a disconnect and reconnect of the adapter.

## Install

```node iobroker.js add mqtt```

## Usage

### How to test mqtt client:
- Set type to "Client".
- Leave port on 1883.
- Set URL as "broker.mqttdashboard.com"
- To get absolutely all topics(messages) set pattern to "#".
- To receive all topics for "/4MS" set pattern to "/4MS/#"
- To receive all topics for "/MS and "/floorish" set pattern to "/4MS/#, /floorish/#"

### Examples of using wildcards
The following examples on the use of wildcards, builds on the example provided in topic strings.

- "Sport"
- "Sport/Tennis"
- "Sport/Basketball"
- "Sport/Swimming"
- "Sport/Tennis/Finals"
- "Sport/Basketball/Finals"
- "Sport/Swimming/Finals"

If you want to subscribe to all Tennis topics, you can use the number sign '#', or the plus sign '+'.

- "Sport/Tennis/#" (this will receive "Sport/Tennis" and "Sport/Tennis/Finals")
- "Sport/Tennis/+" (this will receive "Sport/Tennis/Finals" but not "Sport/Tennis")

For JMS topics, if you want to subscribe to all Finals topics, you can use the number sign '#', or the plus sign '+'.

- "Sport/#/Finals"
- "Sport/+/Finals"

For MQTT topics, if you want to subscribe to all Finals topics, you can use the plus sign '+' .

"Sport/+/Finals"

### Tests
The broker was tested with following clients:

- http://mitsuruog.github.io/what-mqtt/
- http://mqttfx.jfx4ee.org/
- http://www.eclipse.org/paho/clients/tool/

## Todo
* Implement resend of "QoS 2" messages after a while.
  Whenever a packet gets lost on the way, the sender is responsible for resending the last message after a reasonable amount of time. This is true when the sender is a MQTT client and also when a MQTT broker sends a message.

* queue packets with "QoS 1/2" for the offline clients with persistent session.
